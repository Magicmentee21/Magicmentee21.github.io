          <ul>
            <li>First time was in 2006.</li>
            <li>My parents went back because they wanted me to meet my siblings and they also wanted to go and 
              spend more time with them in Guatemala.</li>
            <li>Second time was in 2016. By that year we all came to the US. It wasn't me and my parents no more. It was me and siblings 
              and of course my parents.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Family members: I have 2 sisters, the oldest sister has 3 kids, 1 boy and 2 girls. My second sister has 2 kids; they are both boys!
