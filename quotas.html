      <p>Some interesting facts about quotas of immigrants in the U.S. 
        <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/topics/immigration-101">(Reference)</a>
      <ul>
          <li>The INA (Immigration and Nationality Act) allows the United States to grant up to 675,000 permanent 
            immigrant visas each year across various visa categories. On top of those 675,000 visas, the INA sets 
            no limit on the annual admission of U.S. citizensâ€™ spouses, parents, and children under the age of 21. </li>
          <li>There were approximately 320,000 TPS recipients residing in the United States as of May 2021. 
            TPS means Temporary Protected Status.</li>
          <li>Even though more than 80 percent of undocumented immigrants have lived in the United States for over 10 years, 
            many could live out the rest of their lives without any opportunity to become legal residents of this country.</li>
